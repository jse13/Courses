# What Is Machine learning?
Machine learning is giving a computer the data and tools it needs to solve a problem on its own,
rather than explicit instructions on how to solve specific problems.

The high level procedure for an AI might look like:
1. Have some problem that needs to be solved.
2. Create a rule that helps solve that problem.
3. Apply the rule to the problem.
4. Get feedback on the solution that was performed.
5. Adjust the rule if necessary to create a better solution.

# Working with Data
Data is often split into subcategories:
- Training data: a smaller set of the overall dataset that is used to find patterns and train a model.
- Test data: larger dataset that's used to verify and adjust the behavior of the model.

Part of the job of being a machine learning expert is choosing the correct algorithms to use for certain
tasks, such as classification, and appropriately tweaking the hyper-parameters of that formula to produce
the most accurate solutions.

Acquiring data is a simple task, but using it in a meaningful way can be difficult. This is where using
machine learning to solve problems comes in handy.

# Different Ways a Machine Learns
There are a couple broad types of machine learning:

## Supervised Learning
A human acts as a sort of tutor for the machine, correcting its mistakes and
providing feedback so the model can improve. The downside is that a knowledgeable tutor is required to give
the model good feedback so it becomes more accurate.

## Unsupervised Learning
The machine is given data and will figure out to learn on its own over time. The downside is that a larger
amount of data is needed for a model to learn accurately on its own; the quality of the data can also be
important.

## Semi-supervised learning

A mix of the two. The machine may have supervised training for a little bit, then given data so that it can
continue to learn on its own. Semi-supervised learning shares the downsides of both the other forms of
learning.
